Introduction
The Problem: In the fast-paced world of recruitment, HR professionals and hiring managers are drowning in paperwork. They spend countless hours crafting job descriptions (JDs) that are often ambiguous and manually screening hundreds of resumes (CVs), leading to fatigue, unconscious bias, and a slow hiring process.

The Solution: We built TalentScout AI, a “Mini ATS” (Applicant Tracking System) powered by Google Cloud. TalentScout uses Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental to act as an intelligent hiring manager. It performs two critical tasks in a single click:

Audits the Job Description for clarity and generates interview questions.
Auto-Ranks Candidates from the database by semantically comparing their skills against the JD in real-time.
Target Audience: HR Managers and Recruiters

Design
We designed this solution with three key principles in mind: Speed, Simplicity, and Scalability.

We chose a serverless architecture to handle the application logic and hosting. This means we don’t have to manage infrastructure; Google Cloud handles the scaling automatically, allowing us to focus entirely on the code and AI integration.

High-Level Architecture:
Rationale Behind the Choices:

Frontend/Backend Logic: Streamlit (Python): Streamlit allows us to build a beautiful, interactive web UI entirely in Python rapidly. It’s perfect for data and AI applications where speed-to-demo is crucial.
AI Engine: Vertex AI (Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental): We specifically chose the gemini-2.0-flash-exp model. As a "Flash" model, it offers incredibly low latency, making the user experience feel instantaneous. Its advanced multimodal and multilingual capabilities allow it to understand complex JDs and CVs in various languages without extra configuration.
Deployment: Google Cloud Run: We chose this because it scales to zero (cost-effective) and handles the heavy lifting of AI processing without managing servers.
Database: Cloud Firestore: We use this NoSQL document database to store a history of analyzed jobs. Its flexible schema is perfect for storing the JSON-like structured output generated by the AI.
Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have the following:

A Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Account with billing enabled.
Python 3.9+ installed.
Google Cloud SDK (gcloud CLI) installed and configured.
Step-by-step instructions
here is the streamlined workflow for a Recruiter or HR Manager to screen candidates in seconds:
1. Input the Job Requirements

Navigate to the main dashboard.
In the “Input Job Description” text area, paste a raw job description.
Example: You can paste a JD for a “Senior Python Developer” written in English, Indonesian, or any language.
2. Trigger the AI Engine

Click the primary button: “✨ Analyze JD & Find Candidates”.
This triggers the dual-process workflow:
Gemini 2.0 Flash analyzes the text structure of your JD.
Simultaneously, it fetches all candidates from the database and performs a semantic match against your requirements.
3. Review AI Analysis (The “Quality Check”)

Look at the “📝 JD Analysis” section at the top of the results.
The AI provides a Clarity Score (1–10) and a critique of your JD.
It also generates 3 Strategic Interview Questions tailored specifically to the skills mentioned in your text, helping you prepare for the interview immediately.
4. View Candidate Rankings (The “Shortlist”)

Scroll down to the “🏆 Top Candidates” table.
The system automatically ranks candidates from Highest Score to Lowest Score.
High Match: Candidates with relevant skills (e.g., Python, AWS) appear at the top with a green progress bar.
Low Match: Irrelevant profiles (e.g., Designers applying for an Engineering role) are pushed to the bottom.
Demo
Upon successful deployment, you will have a professional-grade HR tool.

Feature 1: Intelligent Job Description Analyzer By pasting a raw, unstructured job description, Gemini 2.0 Flash instantly structures it, rates its clarity, and generates tailored interview questions. The markdown rendering in Streamlit makes the output clean and readable.

Feature 2: PDF Resume Matcher The application allows HR to Screening Candidate’s CV. The app extracts the text and utilizes Gemini to compare it against the JD requirements, providing a “Match Score” and highlighting missing critical skills.

What’s next?
This project is a solid foundation, but there’s always room to grow:

- Enhance PDF Parsing: Integrate Google Cloud Document AI for more robust parsing of complex, multi-column CV layouts instead of standard text extraction.
- Add Authentication: Use Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) or Firebase Auth to secure the application for internal corporate use.
- Connect to Real Data: Integrate with Gmail or LinkedIn APIs to automatically fetch incoming CVs.
